Experiment in Arduino

Several operations have been tested which are parts of a research project and the work was published:
1. SD read/write
2. Battery depletion attack
3. Encryption (AES 128/256 and RSA 512 with Big Integer)
4. WiFi connection
5. fitness tracker prototype build
6. Bluetooth connection
7. Message authentication (HMAC)
8. hashing (Sha1 and sha256)
